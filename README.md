##Abstract
This repository is home to our implementation of the final project assignment of the course HY-360 "Files and Databases" (http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy360/), which we attended during the winter semester 2013-2014. The project requirements are described [here](http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy360/2013/project/project.pdf) in Greek.


##System Architecture
Our system is composed by a PHP application and a MySQL database. The PHP application is implemented using the [Yii framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) and follows the [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) architecture.

##Software needed
To run our application, a PHP-enabled HTTP server and a MySQL server are needed. For MS Windows users, the easiest way to install these is using the [XAMPP Installer](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#641).

Team members should also install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on their computers. A Git cheatsheet is available [here](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png).
